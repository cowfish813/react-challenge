# OrbitalRX Coding Challenge

Welcome! This challenge should take you about an hour. 

Start by forking this repo to your own github. When you're done with the exercise and ready to turn in your work, send us the link to your repo.

We installed a couple packages to get you started, so you should run `npm i` to install everything before getting started. To start your server, run `npm start`.

- For the challenge, check out `App.jsx`. At the top of the file are a few `TO DO`s. Our hope is for you to get through the first two, or at least one of them and a dent in the other, in an hour. If you have time, check out the `BONUS` etc TO DO's. 
- We have installed TypeScript in this app, but have not implemented it. We use it in production. If you're comfortable with TS, please feel free to use it, but if you're new to TS, that's fine too and don't worry about it now (we're sure you can pick it up later).
- Feel free to install any packages you like to complete the challenge. If you do, please just let us know below what they were and give us a quick insight--a sentence or two--into why you chose them. 
- Include any other feedback you might have here in the README--if it took you longer than expected, if something wasn't clear. 

## Packages Installed (optional)

## Feedback (optional)
- I was a little confused on refactoring filter as the same variable name was being reinitialized and happened to work. i kinda thought nothing of it until i thought "maybe it's a problem in the future"
- I should've thoroughly read all the directions first before jumping in, or at least come back to it because I realized a bit late that the arrow issue was a bonus separate from the date algo. fixing up the sorting and date arrow issue simultaneously took a bit of time. It was a fun process but time-wise very costly to me seeking perfection off the bat :'C
    Lesson Learned.

- I noticed that I could see others work as well by looking at the number of forks, which could compromise the integrity of the challenge process
